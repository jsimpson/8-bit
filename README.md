# Multi-arch disassemblers and emulators for 8-bit micros

**Note**: This is a work in progress...

Multi-architecture disassembler and emulator implementations for 8-bit microprocessors.

Following a prompt from a good friend, I had wanted to build an x86 disassembler. The x86 architecture being quite challenging, however, led me to consider starting with a smaller CPU. I picked the 8080 because the instruction set and their associated docs are small and concise.

I plan to look at the 6502 and the z80, as well.
