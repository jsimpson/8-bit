# Disassemblers

Multi-architecture disassembler implementations.

Following a prompt from a good friend, I had wanted to build an x86 disassembler. The x86 architecture being quite challenging, however, led me to consider starting with a smaller CPU. I picked the 8080 because the instruction set is concise. I plan to look at the 6502 and the z80 (and perhaps PowerPC) before going back to the x86.

I may implement emulators, too, since I'm already spending this much time in the docs.
